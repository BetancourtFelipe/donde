<h3>FUNCTIONALITIES</h3>


* The front-end of the DONDE app is built using Sass CSS, Next.js 13, and TypeScript.

* DONDE uses robust security measures such as CSRF tokens that protect against cross-site scripting attacks to ensure the security of user data.

* Localities can create a profile on DONDE to showcase their unique features and specializations.

* The AddressAutofill feature is implemented using the mapbox/search-react library and the Mapbox API to automatically fill in address details for localities based on user input.

* The back-end of the app is built using Node.js and Express, which enables the creation of a REST API to send information from the front-end to the back-end.

* The React-Select library is used to implement multiple select options, which are then saved to the PostgresSQL database.

* A query function creates a new object from the first element of the input array and an array of specializations derived from all elements of the array.

* The app features an advanced leaflet map that displays the exact location of each locality using the coordinates provided by Mapbox.

* PostgresSQL is used as the database, a reliable open-source relational database that ensures secure data storage and management.
