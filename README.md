Introducing DONDE, the full-stack web application designed to help you find the perfect location in Vienna. With DONDE, you can explore different localities in Vienna based on their specializations and amenities, making it easier than ever to discover the right place for any occasion.

As a full-stack developer with experience in modern web technologies, I have implemented cutting-edge features into DONDE. The app's front-end component features a sleek and user-friendly map interface, built using Sass CSS, Next.js 13, and TypeScript. This allows users to easily search for localities in specific areas of Vienna and view detailed information about each location.

To ensure the security of user data, DONDE uses CSRF tokens, a robust security measure that protects against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The app's back-end component is built using PostgresSQL, a reliable open-source relational database that ensures secure data storage and management.

Using REST API, I have created a scalable back-end that is responsible for user data management, including user authentication, storing locality information, and managing user preferences. Localities can create a profile on DONDE, where they can showcase their unique features and specializations to potential customers.

The app also features an advanced leaflet map that displays the exact location of each locality, using Mapbox API to provide precise coordinates. This ensures that users can easily find the perfect location for their needs.

Overall, DONDE is a powerful tool that provides an easy and efficient way to find and showcase the perfect location. Whether you're a business owner looking to attract new customers or a user searching for the perfect place, DONDE has everything you need to make the process simple and enjoyable. So why wait?
